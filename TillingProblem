/*
* Given a “2 x n” board and tiles of size “2 x 1”, count the number of ways to tile the given board using the 2 x 1 tiles. A tile can either be placed horizontally i.e., as a 1 x 2 tile or vertically i.e., as 2 x 1 tile.

Examples:

Input: n = 4

Output: 3

Explanation:
*
* For a 2 x 4 board, there are 3 ways

All 4 vertical
All 4 horizontal
2 vertical and 2 horizontal
Input: n = 3

Output: 2

Explanation:

We need 2 tiles to tile the board of size  2 x 3.

We can tile the board using following ways

Place all 3 tiles vertically.
Place 1 tile vertically and remaining 2 tiles horizontally.
*
*
*
* We have two options for each tiles either put it vertically or Horizontly
*
* if i put it vertical then i left with n-1 tiles, and if we put it horizontal we left with
* n-2 tiles because , we need to put one more horizontly
* if n =1 and n=2 answer is n*/

fun calculateTile(n : Int) : Int{

    if (n == 1 || n ==2) {
        return n
    }
    return calculateTile(n-1) + calculateTile(n-2)
}

fun main() {
    print(calculateTile(4))
}
