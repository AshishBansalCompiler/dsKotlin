/*Nth catlan number
*
* catlan number is a series that solv many problem like
*
* 1) Count the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched. For n = 3, possible expressions are ((())), ()(()), ()()(), (())(), (()()).
2) Count the number of possible Binary Search Trees with n keys (See this)
3) Count the number of full binary trees (A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children) with n+1 leaves.
4) Given a number n, return the number of ways you can draw n chords in a circle with 2 x n points such that no 2 chords intersect.
* there are many others
* f(0) =1 f(1) =1 and f(n) = summation from i =0 to N of f(i)*f(n-1)
* there is one foprmula for nth catlan number = (1/n+1)* 2nCn */
